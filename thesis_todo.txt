SECTIONS TO FINISH:
o Acknowledgments
o Introduction
	- be more specific about what this thesis contributes.
o 2.2.1 The Main-Sequence Star
	-clean sentence order, reconsider including all the equations of stellar structure.
o 2.2.2 The Main-Sequence Homology Relations
	-fix example, because proxima centauri is a bad example. Use Tau Ceti, instead. 0.55L_sun
o 2.2.3 ZAMS to TAMS
	-proofread and spell-check
o 2.2.4 Metallicity
	-Clean writing and check for typos, otherwise good.
o 2.2.5 The Roche Potential 
	-add conclusion and fix first formula.
o 2.2.6 The Geometrical Elements of Contact Binary Systems
o 2.2.7 Thermal Equilibrium Models 
	-rewrite the majority of this section.
	-discuss lucy model
	-some scientists no longer believe the roche model is adequate.
o 2.2.8 Surface Brightness
o 2.3 Interior Structure
	-donâ€™t need to derive the criterion for stellar convection, only mention that it is derived.
o 2.8 Early-Type Contact Binaries
	-worth providing some context on why this section is included.
o 4.3 O-C Analysis
	-Relate period change to M dot using equations from existing literature.
o 5 Working with Survey Data
	-explain the characteristics of CRTS data.

COMPLETED
 2.2.3 ZAMS to TAMS
	-find percentage change in radius / temperature from ZAMS to TAMS.
